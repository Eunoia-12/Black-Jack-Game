        <h3>Blackjack Game</h3>
        <p>Blackjack is a popular card game played between one or more players and a dealer. The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.</p>
        <p>Card values: Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1.</p>
        <p>Since this is a simple project the computer makes for the dealer and randomly hands out 2 numbers</p>
        <p>The goal is to get a sum of 21. You win the game! Get a chip points of 100</p>
        <p>If not your out of the game! You lose 10 chip points</p>
        <p>Click on the start game button to start a new game</p>
        <p>The new card gives you a new card till you either win or lose the game.!</p>
        <p>All the best!</p>
